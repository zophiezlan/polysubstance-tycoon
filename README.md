# 🌙 THE NIGHT MANAGER™

> An incremental idle game about accidentally learning harm reduction through optimizing yourself into a corner

## What is this?

A satirical web toy where you're the night manager of your own chaos. Buy substances that generate Vibes. Watch your stats. Try to make it to the end of the night.

The game lies to you when you're doing badly. The UI corrupts when your memory fails. Your confidence goes up as everything falls apart.

## The Hook

This isn't a harm reduction brochure disguised as a game. It's a systems simulation that teaches through consequences, not lectures. You learn by pattern recognition across multiple runs:

- "Wait, every time I stack Alcohol + Sedative I collapse."
- "Oh. OH. This is teaching me about compound risk."

Harm reduction concepts appear as optimization strategies. Safety information is encoded in mechanics, not instructions.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # Start dev server
npm run build   # Build for production
```

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Pure CSS (no frameworks - we're going for that cursed vaporwave terminal aesthetic)
- localStorage for save/load

## Features

### Core Loop
- Click "RUN THE NIGHT" to generate Vibes
- Purchase substances that passively generate Vibes
- Balance Energy, Chaos, and hidden Strain meters
- Use maintenance actions (water, food, breaks) to stay alive
- Complete nights to gain Experience and unlock Knowledge

### Systems
- **5 substance archetypes** with realistic interaction mechanics
- **Hidden meters** that unlock as you gain Knowledge
- **Polysubstance interactions** that multiply risk
- **UI distortion** when Confidence is high or Memory is low
- **Prestige system** for meta-progression
- **Achievement tracking** with satirical feedback

### Safety Framework
- No dosage amounts, timing schedules, or combination advice
- Abstracted mechanics (Strain, Collapse) instead of graphic depictions
- Disclaimer on first load with actual resources
- Settings to disable distortion effects for accessibility

## The Vibe

Indie dev making a cursed web toy. Cookie Clicker meets systems thinking meets stealth education.

You optimize. You fail. You learn. You try again with more information.

## Disclaimer

This is satirical systems fiction. It cannot tell you what's safe. Real life has no save states.
